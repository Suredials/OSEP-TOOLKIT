# OSEP-TOOLKIT

Welcome to my OSEP-TOOLKIT repository! This is a curated collection of tools and scripts that I've developed and gathered as part of my preparation journey for the Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP) certification.

The repository is structured to reflect the diverse set of skills required for the exam, ranging from enumeration scripts, exploitation tools, to post-exploitation scripts and various utility tools that enhance the penetration testing process.

Each tool and script is documented to explain its purpose, usage, and any prerequisites needed for its operation. This toolkit is intended to serve not only as my personal arsenal for security assessment challenges but also as a resource for fellow security enthusiasts and professionals who are on the same path towards mastering offensive security techniques.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to this toolkit as we delve into the world of ethical hacking and cybersecurity.

## How to Use

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the specific tool or script you are interested in.
- Refer to the individual README.md files within each directory for instructions on setup and usage.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have any fixes, improvements, or tools to add, please feel free to submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer
